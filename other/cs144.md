The IP Service Model (Details)
1. Tries to prevent packets looping forever. TTL
2. Will fragment packets if they are too long. 1500 Byte
3. Uses a header checksum to reduce chances of delivering datagram to wrong destination.
4. Allows for new versions of IP
    - Currently IPv4 with 32 bit addresses
    - And IPv6 with 128 bit addresses
5. Allows for new options to be added to header.

Packet switch
1. Packet switches are simple: they forward packets independently, and don't need to know about flows.
2. Packet switching is efficient: it lets us efficiently share the capacity among many flows sharing a link.

Reasons for layering
1. Modularity
2. Well defined service
3. Reuse
4. Separation of concerns
5. Continuous improvement
6. Peer-to-peer communications

The TCP Service Model
- Relicable delivery:
  - Acknowledgments indicate correct delivery.
  - Checksums detect corrupted data.
  - Sequence numbers detect missing data.
  - Flow-control prevents overrunning receiver.

Three Error Detection Schemes
- Checksum adds up values in packet (IP, TCP)
- Cyclic redundancy code computes remainder of a polynomial (Ethernet)
- Message authentication code: cryptographic transformation of data (TLS)

Sliding Window Sender
- Every segment has a sequence number (SeqNo)
- Maintain 3 variables
  - Send window size (SWS)
  - Last acknowledgment received (LAR)
  - Last segment sent (LSS)
- Maintain invariant: (LSS - LAR) <= SWS
- Advance LAR on new acknowledgment
- Buffer up to SWS segments
